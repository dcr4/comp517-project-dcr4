Ever since seeing “web browser” included in the course description I was excited to possibly study them or get the opportunity to program one myself.   Almost every (personal) computer in the world has a web browser installed.  As such a major part of modern computing, it is important to have an in-depth understanding of how they function.  I have chosen to implement a web browser in a high level language in order to show to the readers of my paper the inner workings of a web browser, how the web browser interfaces with the operating system, and possible security vulnerabilities and how to avoid them.  While I am not yet 100% sure of how much I will be able to implement, I plan for the web browser to have the ability to download web pages, format text, draw to the screen, parse and apply both html and css, and interface with the operating system.
